# Magic-Eight-Ball

This project is about control flow! It’s so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.

This project is based on the Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.

The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.
